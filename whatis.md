## Why am I being asked to do one?

You are being asked to do a One Way Interview because you stand out amongst all other candidates, and the company + recruiter wants to learn more about you! This is the easiest and fastest way for you to lock down an in person or phone interview with the company. Video is an opportunity to showcase your personality, and show why you're a great fit for the position.

## Who watches my videos?

The company looking to hire you (and your recruiter) watch your videos from a private, secure account. Only those involved in your hiring process will watch your videos.

## Are there any tips for the interview?
Yes! See [Video Interview Cheat Sheet](/en/article/video-interview-cheat-sheet-18c6e62/)

## What's in it for me?

Because you can take the interview on your own time, it gives you the opportunity to prepare and set up a comfortable setting so that you can showcase yourself in the best possible way.
