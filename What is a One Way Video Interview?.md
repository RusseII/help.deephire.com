# What is a one-way video interview?

Your recruiter wants to move you to the next step of the recruiting process, and has a few interview questions that they requested you respond to. 

This is a One Way Video Interview - which means you can answer each question on video, at your own convenience (with unlimited retakes! )

## When I click the link, what can I expect? 

When you click your interview link, you will be able to watch an Introduction Video provided by your recruiter. 

The video typically introduces the job details to you, and will explain the rest of the process. 

## Can I do a Practice Interview to see what it will be like? 

There is not a "Practice Interview" but since you have unlimited retakes, you can start the interview, and practice an unlimited amount of times before submitting. If there is a problem, you can leave the video interview and come back to it later.  

 
## What if I don't have a webcam?

If you don't have a webcam on your computer, you can access the interview on your phone or tablet. 

Just open the interview link on the browser app of your phone (usually Safari or Chrome).
